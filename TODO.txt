# TODO - High

 * If entity is removed from scene, recursively remove its children(?)

# Entities/Components to Write

--------
* Add property to make Missiles only target entities
that haven't been targeted

* Make SeekTarget listen to 'entitiesadded'

* How to conditionally add LingerHurtComponent (Missiles should just be hurt)

* Bullets have linger hurt 
 if bullets kill an enemy rocket, the rockets should immediately be destroyed
