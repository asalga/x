// We need a way to 'turn off' an entity
// so that it no longer responds to events
// and it doesn't get rendered
// but it should still update so it can do any
// necessary work

// 1 - remove from scene?
	// if they are removed from the scene, they won't be updated
	 // some entities are children, so adding them back....we would need a parent pointer
// 2 - add visible and events flag?
// 3 - 

 entity.visible = false;
 entity.events = false;
